# Statistical Demography Summer School at PKU

This is the [course website](https://annazhang1998.github.io/PKUdmg2020/) of the PKU summer school on **Statistical Demography**.

The lectures are **9:00-12:00 on July 6-17 (Monday-Friday), 2020**.

To practise proposed algorithms, please bring your own labtop and [install R](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) in advance.

The lectures will be **in English**.

On our [repository on github ``PKUdmg2020``](https://github.com/annazhang1998/PKUdmg2020)  , you can get more files and codes of the course.
 
## Course Information
The courses will be given by [**Prof. Adrian Raftery**](https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/), [**Prof. Junni Zhang**](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/jnzhang/home) and [**Prof. Ting Li**](http://ssps.ruc.edu.cn/index.php?s=/Index/teacher_cont/cid/8/teaid/41.html)  at Peking University.

- **Adrian Raftery** is the Boeing International Professor of Statistics and Sociology at the
University of Washington in Seattle, USA, and a member of the US National Academy of
Sciences. He is the leader of the [Bayesian Population research group](http://bayespop.csss.washington.edu) that developed many of the methods to be taught in the course .
- **Junni Zhang** is an Associate Professor of Statistics at *National School of Development, Peking University*, and the coauthor of Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting (CRC Press, 2018).
- **Ting Li** is an Associate Professor of Demography at *the Center for Population and Development Studies, Renmin University of China*.

## Schedule & Organization

Lectures will take place from **9:00-12:00 every Monday-Friday**, leaving the afternoons to review the
material, do exercises and work in groups. We will alternate between lectures and computer
labs. The computer labs give students the opportunity to put the theory into practice.

package

**Week 2 (July 13-17): Advanced topics in Statistical Demography**
- Topic 8: Modeling mortality (by Prof. Ting Li)
- Topic 9: Probabilistic migration projection
- Topic 10: Subnational probabilistic population projections
- Topic 11: Bayesian population reconstruction
- Topic 12: Inferring Demographic Arrays and Demographic Accounts (by Prof. Junni Zhang)

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have taken at least a basic first year graduate statistics sequence, and to have a basic familiarity with R. Students should bring their laptops with R installed. They are encouraged to download, install and experiment with the R packages: [``bayesTFR``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesTFR/index.html), [``bayesLife``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesLife/index.html) and [``bayesPop R``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesPop/index.html).

For those who may not be familiar with **Bayesian Statistics**, you can prepare yourself with the links listed in the resource.
