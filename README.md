# Statistical Demography Summer School at PKU

This is the [course website](https://annazhang1998.github.io/PKUdmg2020/) of the PKU summer school on **Statistical Demography**.

The lectures are **9:00-12:00 on July 6-17 (Monday-Friday), 2020**.

The lectures will be **in English**.

You may visit our [repository on github](https://github.com/annazhang1998/PKUdmg2020)  ``PKUdmg2020`` to get the files and codes for the course.
 
## Course Information
The courses will be given by [**Prof. Adrian Raftery**](https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/), [**Prof. Junni Zhang**](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/jnzhang/home) and [**Prof. Ting Li**](http://ssps.ruc.edu.cn/index.php?s=/Index/teacher_cont/cid/8/teaid/41.html)  at Peking University.

- **Adrian Raftery** is the Boeing International Professor of Statistics and Sociology at the
University of Washington in Seattle, USA, and a member of the US National Academy of
Sciences. He is the leader of the [Bayesian Population research group](http://bayespop.csss.washington.edu) that developed many of the methods to be taught in the course .
- **Junni Zhang** is an Associate Professor of Statistics, National School of Development, Peking
University, and the coauthor of Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting (CRC
Press, 2018).
- **Ting Li** is an Associate Professor of Demography at the Center for Population and Development Studies, Renmin University of China.

## Schedule & Organization

Lectures will take place from **9:00-12:00 every Monday-Friday**, leaving the afternoons to review the
material, do exercises and work in groups. We will alternate between lectures and computer
labs. The computer labs give students the opportunity to put the theory into practice.

## Syllabus

1. Basic concepts of demography.
2. Review of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo.
3. Introduction to probabilistic population projections
4. Probabilistic projection of fertility
5. Probabilistic projection of life expectancy
6. Probabilistic Population Projection
7. Generating and visualizing probabilistic population projections using the bayesPop R
package
8. Probabilistic migration projection
9. Subnational probabilistic population projections
10. Bayesian population reconstruction
11. Modeling mortality (Prof. Ting Li)
12. Inferring Demographic Arrays and Demographic Accounts (Prof. Junni Zhang)

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have taken at least a basic first year graduate statistics sequence, and to have a basic familiarity with R. Students should bring their laptops with R installed. They are encouraged to download, install and experiment with the R packages: [``bayesTFR``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesTFR/index.html), [``bayesLife``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesLife/index.html) and [``bayesPop R``](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesPop/index.html).

For those who may not be familiar with **Bayesian Statistics**, you can prepare yourself with the links listed in the resource.
